Hello. I'm Jamleck.

I am a Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead that loves working in teams solving real world problems and building great software. I help shape teams and develop strategies that can incrementally deliver value through leveraging technology and teamwork.

I have experience in most aspects of software engineering delivery including requirements gathering, project planning, design, development, testing, documentation, deployment, automation, support and technical leadership. My primary programming language is C#, however, I have experience using JavaScript, Python, PHP and other technologies to deliver successful software projects.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jamleck) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/180026/jamleck). For my most up-to-date resume, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamleck/).
