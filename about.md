Hello. I'm Jamleck.

I'm a software engineer and hobbyist photographer who values collaboration, good design, continuous learning and test-driven development (TDD) but above all: continually shipping code.

I live and work in sunny Perth, Western Australia. I do a lot of everything, but Iâ€™m happiest solving problems with Python or C#.

You can  find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jamleck) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/180026/jamleck). For my most up-to-date resume, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamleck/).

Thanks for stopping by.
